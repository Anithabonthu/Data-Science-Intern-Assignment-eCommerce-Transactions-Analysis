# Data-Science-Intern-Assignment-eCommerce-Transactions-Analysis
This repository contains the solution for the Data Science Intern Assignment, where we analyze an eCommerce Transactions dataset to generate insights, build a recommendation system, and perform customer segmentation.
# Task 1:
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
   
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.

# Task-2:
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:

● Use both customer and product information.

● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.

# Task-3:
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).

● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in
between(2 and 10)

● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).

● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
